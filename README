Roberts fork: this fork contains experimental support for running tests in parallel, and shrinking in parallel.
Only the internal evaluation of a property is changed, so the API of QC remains unchanged. There is a module
`Test.QuickCheck.Features` which I've completely commented out for now, so that will obviously not work.

In order to try this out yourself, you must follow three steps:

1: You need to make sure cabal knows where my fork of QC exists. You do this by either cloning this repository onto your local machine and pointing your `cabal.project` to it.
You do this e.g. by adding the line `packages: *.cabal <path-to-qc>/QuickCheck.cabal`. You can also optionally point your cabal to this remote repository. You do this by
editing your `project.cabal` to say
```
source-repository-package
    type: git
    location: https://github.com/Rewbert/quickcheck.git
    -- optionally also add this to point to a particular commit, otherwise you will always get the freshest master commit
    -- tag: 605c7468efe02f584dabf6029c4204ab395183d3
```

2: You need to add some flags when you compile your code. Specifically, `-threaded -feager-blackholing -rtsopts`.

3: Finally, all that is left is to change the call to `quickCheck` with a call to `quickCheckPar`. If you don't want parallel shrinking, you should call `quickCheckParWith (stdArgs { parallelShrinking = False}) property`.

As a sanity check of whether you are using my fork or not, if you run `quickCheckPar` with just 1 HEC available, the word `donkey` will be printed.









This is QuickCheck 2, a library for random testing of program properties.

Add `QuickCheck` to your package dependencies to use it in tests or REPL.

The quickcheck-instances [1] companion package provides instances for types in
Haskell Platform packages at the cost of additional dependencies.

The make-hugs script makes a Hugs-compatible version of QuickCheck.
It may also be useful for other non-GHC implementations.
